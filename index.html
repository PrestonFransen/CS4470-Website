      <p>
        I am a senior CS undergrad. I love hardware, building systems, tinkering
        and I am interested in cyber security. I inted to graduate this December
        and continue my education in a graduate program. I would like to gain a
        better understanding of parallel programming models and implementations
        from this course.

    <h2>Problem.</h2>
    <div class="content-paragraph">
      <p>
        Cracking small key size ciphers. Many cryptographic
        algorithms require multiple independent operations. Because of this, they
        pair well with hardware implementations of parallelization.

       COPACOBANA is a machine designed for this task utilizing commercially available
       field-programmable gate arrays <a href="https://www.xilinx.com/products/silicon-devices/fpga/what-is-an-fpga.html">(FPGA)</a>.
       Each COPACOBANA contains 20 modules with each module containing 6 FPGAs --> total 120
       compute FPGAs. The data bus of each module is interfaced to the global data bus
       on a backplane. FPGAs on the same module can communicate via a local 64-bit data bus.
       Control signals are run over a separate 16-bit address bus. Memory is local to each chip.

    <h2>Performance.</h2>
    <div class="content-paragraph">
      <p>
        COPACOBANA is able to perform cryptographic operations in parallel for applications
        with high computational but low memory and communication requirements. DES
        can be broken within less than a week at an average throughput of 65.3 billion
        searched keys per second.

    <h2>Scalability.</h2>
    <div class="content-paragraph">
      <p>
        Larger keys that rely on DES can continue to be exploited by highly compute
        bound brute-force decryption. Adding more boards to the COPACOBANA and segmenting
        smaller portions of the key space results in a linear speedup.
